At first I write a script for auto-battle. Level-up not very fast, but I thought just let it run a day and it could reach lv.100.

Latter when I check back I found a team reach lv.98 already. And amazingly they set an easy-to-guess password reset question. So i just waited and hijacked their flag. Don't know if this would count as cheating or not hahah.
